# Cyber Defense Club
Welcome to my github page for Cyber Defense Club.  
I use github as a way to share files amongst some more junior Computer Science majors who maybe haven't been introduced to git yet as a way to dip their toes.  

If you want to work alongside with this you can do a couple different things.
1. You can just click on any `.md` file that you want and use it from the browser, no harm no foul
1. You can clone this repo using `git clone` and then copy pasta the link that is provided at the top of the file directory.
